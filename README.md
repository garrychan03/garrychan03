ðŸ‘‹ So happy to meet you here!
I'm Garry CHEN. Currently, I am an undergraduate student in Hong Kong, majoring in Sociology.
I have received formal training in qualitative research methods, and I am also self-studying quantitative research methods.
I'm also a furry fan, and you can find me with my character setting on some other social platforms (such as Twitter). Little Fat Black Shiba would like you to come!
